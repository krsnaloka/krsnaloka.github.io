      <description>Sri Krishna with the meaning   Yogeshwara: Somebody who can understand the mind of anything and anybody. Sri Hari is the Parama (ultimate) Prabhu (leader / father). That&amp;rsquo;s why Sri Krishna is known as Yogeshwara. Also Yogeshwara means somebody who has the ultimate richness and power (which cannot be compared even with any other Demi Gods - even like Sri Brahma Deva, Rudhra Deva and even Sri Mahalakshmi Devi). Yogeshwara: Yogi = Ultimate mind reader / Yoga performer, Ishwara - Supreme to everybody and everything.</description>

🌹 HAPPY NARASIMHA CHATURDASHI! 🌹
Today was the Holy day, when the Supreme Lord, Shrī Narasimhadeva descended to the world to protect His pure devotee Shrī Prahalāda Maharaj.🙏
Shrī Prahalāda Maharaja was an exalted and pure devotee of Shrī Hari, who had unflinching faith and devotion towards The Lord. His demonic father Hiranyakashipu tortured Him so much for that, but Shrī Prahalāda did not lose any faith in Shrīman Narayana, but in fact His love and devotion grew more for The Lord.</description>

      <description>[Weitergeleitet von అరుణాచలం] 🌈🙏🌈🙏🌈🙏🌈🙏🌈🙏🌈🙏🌈🙏
Devas reached Goloka and had darshana of Lord Krishna in his yugala swaroopa along with Radha Rani.
As they were wondering why the lord is described as Paripoornatama – poorna means complete, paripoorna means totally complete, paripoorna tama means the greatest among those who are totally complete. That is the status of Lord Krishna among divinities.
For being paripoorna tama, there should be nothing other than him.</description>

      <description>Became a Devotee of Nrsimhadeva [Weitergeleitet von Bala Srini]
This section of the Hari-bhakti-vilasa 14.418-441, (the glories of Nrsimha-caturdasi) quoting from Brhan Nrsimha Purana , describes who Prahlada Maharaja was in his previous life and how he became a Narasimha Bhakta.
Prahlada said: O Supreme Lord! I bow down to You. O Lord Nrsimhadeva, I offer my obeisances to You. I am Your devotee. O Lord of lords, I now express to You my heartfelt inquiry.</description>
