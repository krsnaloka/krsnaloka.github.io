  He who recites that spell (ugram viram mahavisnum), recites all the Vedas, he offers all sacrifices, he bathes in all sacred bathing places, he is released from the great sins and from the secondary sins, he attains great preeminence in sacred knowledge (great holiness), he purifies his relatives (the people of his line), his first ancestors from Brahman forth and his descendants unto the end of the world.</description>

      <description>Sri Krishna with the meaning   Yogeshwara: Somebody who can understand the mind of anything and anybody. Sri Hari is the Parama (ultimate) Prabhu (leader / father). That&amp;rsquo;s why Sri Krishna is known as Yogeshwara. Also Yogeshwara means somebody who has the ultimate richness and power (which cannot be compared even with any other Demi Gods - even like Sri Brahma Deva, Rudhra Deva and even Sri Mahalakshmi Devi). Yogeshwara: Yogi = Ultimate mind reader / Yoga performer, Ishwara - Supreme to everybody and everything.</description>
